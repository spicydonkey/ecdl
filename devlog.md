* [ ] Finish Bryce's design (B01)

### Things to consider
* Cavity length stabilisation: Slow drift in cavity length arises from thermal expansion of ECDL block, in addition to acoustic and mechanical vibrations coupled from outside. Thermally induced variation in cavity length should be small compared to the PZT tuning range (~2um), which encourages short cavity length. Mechanical and acoustic coupling could be minimised by increasing the thickness of the block walls, as well as incorporating passive vibration damping material.
* A *wedge* window should be used to the free-space beam outlet port. Forming an additional optical cavity should be avoided while laser output and hermetic sealing is desired.
* Selecting a piezo transducer: disk type preferred, easy gluing.
